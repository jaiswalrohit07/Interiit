Hello Everyone,
I'm delighted to share that our team #B76 has secured a silver medal in the recent participation in the Inter IIT Tech Meet 11.0, I led the contingent along with Himanshu to tackle QuantInsti's problem statement on the efficacy of price action trading strategies in the context of the Indian equities market.

We developed sophisticated tools and methods to detect price action signals automatically and formulated a hypothesis that explored the market's tendency to retrace and fill inefficiencies, which could provide potential opportunities for profitable trades in liquid stocks. We identified inefficient candles from the OHLC chart to test this hypothesis and formulated the inefficient zone. We then backtested the hypothesis on over 60+ stocks, selected based on a stock filter for liquid, moderately volatile, and non-penny stocks from all the listed stocks available in Blueshift. Our results showed that the market retraced back to the inefficient zone 99.8% of the time.

To test the profitability of this hypothesis in low frequency, we converted the 1-minute price-time data to price-volume with dynamic volume bins, allowing us to significantly decrease false signals and fix the noise. Taking entry next to the verified candle and squaring off when the high of the market reached the upper zone, we generated consistent profits from the market, which we confirmed through backtesting over multiple stocks.

This event has taught me a lot and helped extract my potential as a team leader. I'll remember everything from the work sessions, ideation meets and the nights that turned into mornings. I extend my heartfelt thanks to my brilliant & dedicated teammates - Himanshu Kumar, Samarth Pusalkar, Shaunak Natarajan, Amlan Biswas, Kartik, Piyush Banka, and Prajyot, whose tireless efforts and valuable contributions were instrumental in achieving our impressive results.
